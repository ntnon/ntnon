## Hi there 👋
My name is Anton and I am a Norwegian PhD student!

I prefer minimal code with few dependencies and I like learning new technologies to overcome small or large problems!

Some technologies I am currently interested in:
- [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
- [Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay)
- [Typst](https://typst.app/)
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

Some programming influencer that inspire me:
- [Sylvan Franklin](https://sylvanfranklin.com/)
- [Nic Barker](https://www.nicbarker.com/)

### Research
My research lies at the intersection of data science and medicine. I focus on identifying digital biomarkers in patients with Lewy Body Dementia, aiming to leverage technology to improve diagnosis and patient outcomes.

### On another note
I am currently learning C and game design!
