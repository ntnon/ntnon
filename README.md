## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Anton and I am a Norwegian PhD student!

### Research
My research lies at the intersection of data science and medicine. I focus on identifying digital biomarkers in patients with Lewy Body Dementia, aiming to leverage technology to improve diagnosis and patient outcomes.

On another note: I am currently learning C and game design
