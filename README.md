## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m Anton, a Norwegian PhD student passionate about blending data science and medicine to make a meaningful impact.

I believe in writing clean, minimal code with as few dependencies as possibleâ€”and I love exploring new technologies to solve problems big and small.

### Currently Exploring  
Here are some cool tools and projects that have caught my interest lately:  
- [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) â€” Simple and easy-to-use game programming library  
- [Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay) â€” High performance UI layout library in C
- [Typst](https://typst.app/) â€” A modern typesetting system  
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/) â€” A fast code editor  
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) â€” A powerful note management tool  

### Inspirations  
Some programming minds who inspire me:  
- [Sylvan Franklin](https://sylvanfranklin.com/)  
- [Nic Barker](https://www.nicbarker.com/)
- [Kenneth Ward](https://www.youtube.com/@IncandescentGames)

### Research Focus  
My work sits at the crossroads of data science and medicine, with a focus on identifying digital biomarkers in patients with Lewy Body Dementia. My goal is to harness technology to improve diagnosis and patient care.

### Side Quest  
Right now, Iâ€™m diving into C programming and game design â€” excited to build fun and functional projects!
